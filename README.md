# sam-hello-world

This project contains source code that serves as a base template for other SAM applications. This project is configured to use TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.

## Deploy the sample application

To use the SAM CLI, you need the following tools.

- SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- Node.js - [Install Node.js 12](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool.
- Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)

Build the TypeScript code first by going to the app directory and running the build script:

```bash
cd app
npm run build
```

Go back to the project's root directory.

Build and deploy the application with the following commands:

```bash
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts.
